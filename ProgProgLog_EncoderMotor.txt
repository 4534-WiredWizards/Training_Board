Welcome to the Programming Progress Log, or ProgProgLog for short.

This is where we will track what has happened each meeting, as well as what the next goal is, with respect to each branch of the code.

**************************** EncoderMotor Branch Overall Goals ****************************
These are the overarching, conceptual goals for the project.

Level 0: Part exists, Developers can access it.  --ACHIEVED 12-6-2017--
Level 1: Part has baseline functions and commands to move.
Level 2: Part is fully operational, featuring command to turn a given distance or rate.
Level 3: Part is optimized to execute in the most efficient way, implementing tools like PID.

**************************** EncoderMotor Branch Current Plans ****************************
These are the specific tasks yet to be done, sorted by goal level.

Level 1:
Begin turnDistance

Level 2:
Add turnRate command

Level 3:
Use PID to set and hold a rate
